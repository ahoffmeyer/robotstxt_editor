Users manual
============

Documentation of how to use the extension, how it works, how to apply it, if it's a website plugin.

Language should be non-technical, explaining, using small examples. Don't use to many acronyms unless they have been explained.

Examples: For the "News" plugin this would be a manual showing how to create the news items, explaining the options etc.

Provide screenshots of a neutral Backend such as the Backend of the Introduction Package for instance. Have in mind that the User manual could possibly be re-used in a larger documentation compilation, for example when a company generates a documentation for its client.

Target group: **Users**

Link to official documentation
------------------------------

Sphinx makes it easy to link to official TYPO3 documentation:

- :ref:`TYPO3 Tutorial for Editors <t3editors:start>`
- :ref:`Getting Started Tutorial <t3start:start>`

and you may even link to a very specific chapter explaining how to :ref:`create a browser condition <t3tsref:condition-browser>` within the TypoScript Reference.

For a complete reference of available cross-link prefixes, please consult file ``_make/conf.py``.
